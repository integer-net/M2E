    You can use a Manual Search for each added Product by clicking on the icon in the "ASIN/ISBN" Column of the Grid. <br/>

    Also you can use Automatic Search for added Product(s) by choosing <i class="underline">"Search ASIN/ISBN Automatically"</i> Option in a mass Actions bulk in the top right corner of the Grid. The Search will be performed according to the values which set in Search Settings. <br/><br/>

    You can always set or change Settings of the source for ASIN/ISBN and UPC/EAN by clicking <i class="underline">"Edit Search Settings"</i> Button in the right top corner. <br/><br/>

    <b>Note:</b> The process of Automatic Search might be time-consuming, depending on the number of added Products the Search is applied to. <br/><br/>

    The detailed information about using Search Tool of Amazon Products you can find in the following article <a href="http://docs.m2epro.com/LINK_ANCHOR">here</a>'); ?>
